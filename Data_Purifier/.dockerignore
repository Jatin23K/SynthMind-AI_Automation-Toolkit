# .dockerignore
# This file specifies intentionally untracked files and directories that Docker should ignore
# when building an image. Ignoring unnecessary files helps to reduce the Docker image size,
# speed up build times, and improve security by not including sensitive or irrelevant data.

# Ignore Git-related artifacts.
# These files are specific to version control and are not needed in the Docker image.

# and are not required for the application to run inside the Docker container.
