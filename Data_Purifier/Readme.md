## Architecture

This section describes the overall design and operational flow of the Data Purification System. It highlights the multi-agent paradigm and the sequential steps involved in processing data from input to final output.

The system operates on a multi-agent paradigm, orchestrated by the `OrchestratorAgent`. The workflow is as follows:

1.  **User Input**: The user provides paths to raw CSV datasets, a meta-information file (describing data and analytical goals), and desired output paths.
    *Comment: This is the starting point of the pipeline, where the user defines the data to be processed and the desired outcomes.*
2.  **`MetaAnalyzerAgent`**: Reads the meta-information file (e.g., `meta_output.txt`), uses an LLM to parse the desired schema, analytical questions, and a preliminary processing plan (`pipeline_plan` and `suggested_operations`). It then loads the raw CSV datasets, **converts them internally to the highly efficient Feather format**, and performs initial standardization (column renaming, type enforcement) and filtering based on the parsed meta-info. It also ensures data uniqueness after loading.
    *Comment: This step is crucial for understanding the input data and generating an initial, intelligent plan for the subsequent agents. The use of Feather format is highlighted as a performance optimization.*
3.  **`OrchestratorAgent`**: Takes the prepared DataFrame and the LLM-generated processing plan. It sequentially delegates tasks to specialized agents for cleaning, modification, and transformation. It manages adaptive retries and incorporates learned optimizations from validation feedback.
    *Comment: The Orchestrator acts as the central coordinator, ensuring that each data processing stage is executed in the correct order and that the pipeline can adapt to challenges.*
4.  **Specialized Agents (`CleanerAgent`, `DataModifierAgent`, `TransformerAgent`)**: Each agent performs its specific set of operations on the data, leveraging adaptive logic to choose optimal methods based on data characteristics and LLM insights.
    *Comment: This describes the core workhorses of the system, each focusing on a specific aspect of data purification (cleaning, modifying, transforming) with built-in intelligence.*
5.  **Validation Agents (`CleaningValidatorAgent`, `ModificationValidatorAgent`, `TransformationValidatorAgent`)**: After each processing stage, a dedicated validator agent assesses the quality of the work. If issues are found, it generates specific recommendations.
    *Comment: This highlights the self-correction mechanism, where dedicated agents verify the output of processing stages to maintain data quality.*
6.  **Feedback Loop**: The `OrchestratorAgent` receives validation results. If validation fails, it incorporates the validator's recommendations into the processing instructions and retries the failed stage (up to a configurable limit), making the pipeline adaptive.
    *Comment: This explains how the system learns and improves, using feedback from validation to refine its approach and re-attempt failed operations.*
7.  **`ProcessRecorderAgent`**: Continuously logs all activities, decisions, and outcomes throughout the entire pipeline, including the *reasons* for adaptive choices, creating a comprehensive audit trail.
    *Comment: This emphasizes the transparency and auditability of the system, providing a detailed record of every action taken.*
8.  **Final Output**: Once all stages are successfully completed, the final purified DataFrame (which was processed internally as Feather) is saved to the specified output path, typically back into a `.csv` file.
    *Comment: This is the culmination of the data processing, where the cleaned and transformed data is made available to the user.*
9.  **Comprehensive Reporting**: The `ProcessRecorderAgent` generates a highly detailed JSON report summarizing the entire purification run, explaining *what* operations were performed, *why*, and their *impact* on data quality.
    *Comment: This provides a summary of the entire process, offering insights into the effectiveness of the purification and the decisions made by the agents.*

    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**:
    *Comment: This command installs all the necessary Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.*
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Download spaCy and NLTK models**:
    *Comment: The `MetaAnalyzerAgent` (for NLP tasks like text analysis) and `TransformerAgent` (for text processing) rely on specific language models from spaCy and NLTK. These commands download and install the required models.*
    The `MetaAnalyzerAgent` uses spaCy for NLP, and `TransformerAgent` uses NLTK. For consistent deployments, it's recommended to pre-download these models:
    ```bash
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
    python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('stopwords'); nltk.download('wordnet')"
    ```


## Dockerization (Optional)

This section provides instructions on how to containerize the application using Docker. Docker ensures consistent and isolated deployments across various environments.

1.  **Build the Docker image**:
    *Comment: This command builds the Docker image based on the `Dockerfile` in the current directory. The `-t` flag tags the image with a name (`data-purifier`) for easy reference.*
    ```bash
    docker build -t data-purifier .
    ```
2.  **Run the Docker container**:

## Internal Data Handling (Feather Files)

This section explains the system's internal data management strategy, focusing on the use of Apache Feather files for optimized performance.

To optimize performance, the system internally uses the Apache Feather file format for data processing:

-   **Input**: You provide data in `.csv` format.
    *Comment: The system accepts common CSV files as input, making it easy for users to provide their data.*
-   **Conversion**: The `MetaAnalyzerAgent` automatically converts input `.csv` files to `.feather` format upon loading and caches them. All subsequent processing by the `CleanerAgent`, `DataModifierAgent`, and `TransformerAgent` operates on this efficient binary format in memory.
    *Comment: This highlights a key performance optimization where data is converted to a more efficient binary format early in the pipeline for faster in-memory processing.*
-   **Benefits**: This approach significantly improves data loading/saving speed, reduces memory footprint, and ensures precise preservation of data types throughout the pipeline, minimizing potential data quality issues that can arise from repeated CSV parsing.
    *Comment: This explains the advantages of using Feather files, such as speed, memory efficiency, and data integrity.*
-   **Output**: The final purified dataset is saved back to your specified output path in `.csv` format for easy accessibility and compatibility.
    *Comment: While internal processing is optimized, the output is provided in a widely compatible format for user convenience.*


## Running Tests

This section provides instructions on how to execute the test suite to ensure the system's functionality and stability.

To ensure the system's functionality and stability, run the test suite using `pytest`:

```bash
pytest tests/
```
*Comment: This command executes all tests located within the `tests/` directory using the `pytest` framework. Running tests regularly helps verify that changes haven't introduced regressions and that the system behaves as expected.*

-   **Enhanced Error Handling & Logging**: Critical sections across agents now feature more specific error handling and detailed logging, providing clearer insights into potential issues during runtime and aiding in debugging.
    *Comment: This ensures that the system is more resilient to unexpected issues and provides better diagnostic information when problems occur.*
-   **Refined Secrets Management Guidance**: The configuration loading (`config/settings.py`) now includes explicit recommendations for managing API keys and other sensitive information directly via environment variables in production, moving away from reliance on `.env` files for deployed systems.
    *Comment: This promotes secure handling of sensitive data, which is a critical aspect of production deployments.*
-   **Version-Pinned Dependencies**: All project dependencies in `requirements.txt` are now explicitly version-pinned, ensuring reproducibility across different environments and preventing unexpected behavior due to library updates.
    *Comment: This guarantees that the application will run with the exact same library versions in all environments, preventing compatibility issues.*
-   **Scalability & Performance Optimizations**: Implemented parallel data loading, optimized cleaning operations (e.g., adaptive imputation, robust duplicate removal), and efficient LLM interactions to enhance processing speed.
    *Comment: These optimizations contribute to the system's ability to handle larger datasets and process them more quickly.*
-   **Containerization**: A `Dockerfile` is provided, enabling consistent and isolated deployment across various environments.

    *Comment: This suggests a path for scaling the system to handle datasets that exceed the capacity of a single machine.*
-   **LLM Cost Optimization**: Implementing more aggressive token usage monitoring and potentially exploring local LLM solutions for certain tasks to reduce API costs.
    *Comment: This addresses the practical concern of managing costs associated with using external Large Language Models in a production setting.*


## Performance Optimization

This section provides strategies and best practices to enhance the speed and efficiency of the Data Purification System, covering LLM interactions, data processing, and resource management.

To enhance the speed and efficiency of the Data Purification System, consider the following strategies:

### LLM Interaction Optimization
-   **Model Choice**: For tasks not requiring the highest reasoning, configure `config/settings.py` to use faster, smaller LLM models (e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo` or `gpt-4o-mini`) to reduce latency and cost.
    *Comment: Selecting an appropriate LLM model based on the task's complexity can significantly impact performance and operational costs.*
-   **Prompt Engineering**: Optimize prompts for conciseness and directness to achieve faster LLM response times and lower token usage.
    *Comment: Well-crafted prompts reduce the amount of data sent to and received from the LLM, leading to quicker interactions.*
-   **Parallel LLM Calls**: Explore parallelizing independent LLM calls using `asyncio` or `multiprocessing` where applicable, leveraging the asynchronous capabilities of `CachedChatOpenAI`.
    *Comment: Concurrent execution of LLM calls can drastically reduce the total time spent waiting for responses, especially when multiple independent queries are needed.*

### Data Processing Efficiency
-   **Leverage Feather/Parquet**: Ensure data is converted to Apache Feather format as early as possible and processed in this format throughout the pipeline. For final output, consider saving directly to Parquet if CSV is not a strict requirement, as it can be faster for large datasets.
    *Comment: Using efficient binary data formats like Feather or Parquet minimizes I/O overhead and memory usage during data manipulation.*
-   **Pandas Optimization**:
    -   **Vectorization**: Prioritize vectorized Pandas operations over row-wise iterations (`df.apply(axis=1)`) for significant speed improvements.
        *Comment: Vectorized operations are implemented in highly optimized C code, making them much faster than Python-level loops.*
    -   **Dask Integration**: For datasets exceeding available memory, integrate Dask DataFrames to enable out-of-core processing with a familiar Pandas-like API.
        *Comment: Dask allows processing datasets larger than RAM by breaking them into smaller chunks and processing them in parallel.*
-   **Extend Multiprocessing**: Identify and implement parallel execution for other computationally intensive, independent operations within agents, similar to the existing multiprocessing for missing value imputation in `CleanerAgent`.
    *Comment: Distributing computational tasks across multiple CPU cores can significantly reduce processing time for large datasets.*

### Resource Management
-   **Hardware Allocation**: Ensure the environment running the purification process has adequate CPU cores and RAM, especially when dealing with large datasets or enabling parallel processing.
    *Comment: Sufficient hardware resources are fundamental for achieving optimal performance, particularly for memory-intensive data operations.*
-   **Docker for Consistency**: Utilize the provided `Dockerfile` to ensure a consistent and isolated execution environment, which helps in preventing performance variations due to differing system configurations.
    *Comment: A consistent environment eliminates performance discrepancies caused by differences in installed libraries or system configurations.*
-   **Logging Level**: During performance testing or production runs, adjust the `LOG_LEVEL` in `config/settings.py` to a higher level (e.g., `WARNING` or `ERROR`) to minimize logging overhead, as extensive logging can sometimes impact performance.
    *Comment: Reducing the verbosity of logs can decrease I/O operations and CPU usage, improving overall performance.*
-   **Profiling and Bottleneck Identification**:
    -   **Utilize `cProfile`**: Leverage the integrated `cProfile` in `main.py`. Analyze the generated `.prof` files with tools like `snakeviz` to precisely identify performance bottlenecks and time-consuming functions.
        *Comment: Profiling is a critical step in identifying exactly where the application spends most of its time, guiding targeted optimization efforts.*
    -   **Targeted Optimizations**: Focus optimization efforts on the areas identified as bottlenecks through profiling for the most impactful improvements.
        *Comment: By focusing on the most time-consuming parts of the code, developers can achieve the greatest performance gains with minimal effort.*
